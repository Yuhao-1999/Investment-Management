## Investment management 

Nowadays, there exist thousands of professions and job positions. People work around the world, starting with their childhood jobs like delivering newspapers, continuing with student jobs and their own positions. Sometimes it turns out that one or another person gets profit, that they don’t know what to do with, should they buy a new phone or buy a new sofa for an apartment or a new apartment if budget allows? 
Sometimes people don’t need to buy anything, however the funds they have are then just laying in the bank or as cash in a drawer. When money does not work and is just waiting for the right time, in most cases it means that the person is losing money, since the global inflation of 5,7% impacts their cost, which means 5,7% of the funds will lose. However, there is a better way to treat money, money is a tool that allows us to change our lives. 
Not in vain, investment became one of the biggest trends in 2021. Choosing to invest your funds means that you choose to invest in your future. Not only is it an opportunity to multiply your budget but also by investing your money in startups, big companies, stocks, fundraising ideas and many more, creates a value for country and global economics, allows new ideas to become real and not to be buried.
Investment is a complex process that requires patience, calculations and forecasting. However it is when we talk about professional people who do the investment for living. When we talk about regular people that do not know anything about investment, the biggest catch will be to decide where to invest.
Different people have different budget for investment, one can have 100kr then good possibility is to invest in somebodies project on crowdfunding or fundraising, another has 10000 kr and he can maybe invest in the startup, another has 1 000 000kr and it would make sense to invest them in real estate or some bigger business.
